Client/Server game for 2 players in Java

Written in Java as semestral paper in "Client/server applications in Java" (4IT353 - VÅ E)

Demonstrates the concept of socket connection in Java. Two players connects each other using server.
Clients communicate with server using text commands.

Each player recieves 15 random game tiles. Game tile is square that contains 4 numbers 0-9 at each of its side.
Players are placing tiles to the game plan (5x5). When tile is placed to other tile's side with lower number,
player who owns it overtakes this tile. The key to win is to overtake opponent's tiles while preserving own tiles
from being taken.

The program doesn't look very good atm, but it works just fine. And I hope I will be able to improve the concept in the future.
